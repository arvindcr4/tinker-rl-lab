## Overview
`echoverse_matrix_run.py` is an entry point that parses intent from the command line and dispatches to the underlying machinery. It translates `--framework/--backend` flags into a plan, then executes or dry-runs it, acting as the seam between human intent and framework-specific code.
It leans on **argparse, config, csv, dataclass, logging, protocol, regex, subprocess, wandb** to do its work.
*Self-description:* "Run Echoverse sweeps from Colab/CLI with full task coverage and multi-seed replication.  Goals aligned to reviewer concerns:  * Run complete env × task grids (o"

## Key Components
- `TaskResult` -- class (1 methods: as_json)
- `RunResult` -- class (2 methods: pass_rate, as_json)
- `_parse_csv_ints()` -- function
- `_shorten()` -- function
- `_run_cmd()` -- function
- `ensure_repo()` -- Clone or update the Echoverse repo.  If the checkout becomes inconsistent, fall back to a clean clone.
- `_db_exists_for_env()` -- function
- `ensure_env_dbs()` -- function
- `load_env_tasks()` -- function
- `parse_score_from_verify_output()` -- function
- `parse_verdict_from_verify_output()` -- function
- `read_duration_seconds()` -- function
- `_find_run_root()` -- function
- `_resolve_trajectory_dir()` -- function
- Has a `if __name__ == "__main__"` entry point

## Concepts & Decisions
### One entry, many substrates
- **What**: Every backend eventually re-enters the local dispatch, so the CLI is both the human interface and the remote-on-box interface.

### Data modeling with dataclasses
- **What**: `@dataclass` auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` from field annotations, turning plain classes into compact value objects.
- **Why used here**: The repo models specs, results, and plans as frozen dataclasses so structural equality and hashing come for free and mutation is blocked.
- **When**: For passive data carriers -- configs, results, plans -- especially when you want `==`/hash semantics.
- **Trade-offs**: No validation by itself; frozen fields protect from mutation but not bad values (pair with pydantic for that).

### Structural subtyping with typing.Protocol
- **What**: `Protocol` describes an interface by the *attributes* something has, not by inheritance -- anything matching the shape satisfies it (duck typing with static checks).
- **Why used here**: Lets the code accept `plan`-like and `run`-like objects without forcing a class hierarchy, useful in the shim layer.
- **When**: When many small objects share behavior but have no common ancestor.
- **Trade-offs**: Runtime `isinstance` checks need `@runtime_checkable` and are shallow; static checkers are the real beneficiary.

### Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases
- **What**: W&B records metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts to a hosted or local run timeline, giving every training run a shareable dashboard and history.
- **Why used here**: The repo treats receipts/evidence as first-class outputs, and W&B is one of the three independent channels (HF + W&B + GCS) whose agreement is the trust signal.
- **When**: When a run's value is in its history -- comparing sweeps, auditing, or sharing results without sending weights.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a network dependency and an external account; local-only runs must opt out or write a local fallback.

### CSV I/O
- **What**: `csv` reads/writes comma-separated records, the lingua franca for tabular data and result dumps.
- **Why used here**: Large benchmark/results files are exchanged as CSV, so importing/exporting that format is a direct requirement.
- **When**: When tabular data must be human-openable or compatible with spreadsheets/other tools.
- **Trade-offs**: CSV has no schema or types -- every field is a string, so parsing and quoting edge cases are on you.

### Text processing with regular expressions
- **What**: `re` matches/extracts patterns in text -- parsing logs, sanitizing identifiers, or validating formats that don't warrant a full parser.
- **Why used here**: Receipts, path probes, and name munging are string-shaped; regex is the compact tool for targeted extraction.
- **When**: Small, well-defined text patterns where a parser is overkill.
- **Trade-offs**: Regex is opaque and easy to get subtly wrong; complex grammars should graduate to a real parser.

### Configuration as declarative data (YAML/JSON/TOML)
- **What**: Knobs live in YAML/JSON/TOML files or tables rather than code, so a run's intent is inspectable and diffable without reading the program.
- **Why used here**: A single frozen `CanonicalSpec` + preregistration files is the repo's whole comparability contract -- config-as-data is what makes runs hashable and testable.
- **When**: Anywhere parameters should be changeable without editing code, or compared across runs.
- **Trade-offs**: Config can drift from what the code actually reads; validation (pydantic) is what catches a key that no longer means what it says.

### Process orchestration (subprocess)
- **What**: `subprocess.run`/`Popen` spawns and captures external commands, letting Python drive shell steps, remote CLIs, and other tools as child processes.
- **Why used here**: Remote backends provision a box then shell out to a driver command -- subprocess is the seam between 'plan' and 'actually run elsewhere'.
- **When**: When work is naturally a separate executable: `modal run`, `gcloud`, ssh commands, secondary scripts.
- **Trade-offs**: Argument quoting/escaping and env leakage are footguns; you lose in-process debugging across the boundary.

### Structured diagnostics with logging
- **What**: The `logging` module writes level-filtered messages to stderr/files, separating operational noise from real errors and leaving them toggleable at runtime.
- **Why used here**: Runs are audited, so leaving a trail of INFO/DEBUG statements lets a reviewer reconstruct what happened without rerunning GPUs.
- **When**: Anywhere you'd `print` something that matters: progress, warnings, step boundaries, and fatal errors.
- **Trade-offs**: More setup than `print`; misconfigured handler levels silently swallow the very lines you need in production.

### Command-line argument parsing
- **What**: `argparse` turns `sys.argv` into typed options (`--framework`, `--dry-run`) with help text and error handling for free.
- **Why used here**: Every platform entry point must be runnable by humans and by shelling-out code, so a stable, documented CLI is the contract between them.
- **When**: When a script is invoked by people, CI, or other processes and needs explicit knobs.
- **Trade-offs**: Boilerplate-heavy and positional-only; richer CLIs use click/typer for nesting and auto-generated help.
