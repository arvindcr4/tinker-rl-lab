## Overview
`trl_distillation.py` is an experiment script that exercises a specific research configuration end-to-end. It wires a chosen model, dataset, algorithm, and backend into one reproducible run and records the outcome.
It leans on **dataclass, protocol, torch, transformers, trl, wandb** to do its work.
*Self-description:* "TRL Knowledge Distillation Implementation ========================================== Port of Tinker Distillation experiments to TRL/transformers.  Two approache"

## Key Components
- `DistillationConfig` -- Configuration for knowledge distillation.
- `OnPolicyDistillationTrainer` (bases: Trainer) -- On-policy distillation with KL divergence to teacher. (2 methods: __init__, compute_loss)
- `generate_teacher_dataset()` -- Generate teacher outputs for off-policy distillation.
- `train_off_policy_distillation()` -- Off-policy distillation: SFT on teacher outputs.
- `train_on_policy_distillation()` -- On-policy distillation with KL minimization.
- `main()` -- function
- Has a `if __name__ == "__main__"` entry point

## Concepts & Decisions
### Frozen protocol over flexibility
- **What**: Experiments intentionally give up knob freedom in exchange for equivalence -- comparability beats configurability here.

### Data modeling with dataclasses
- **What**: `@dataclass` auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` from field annotations, turning plain classes into compact value objects.
- **Why used here**: The repo models specs, results, and plans as frozen dataclasses so structural equality and hashing come for free and mutation is blocked.
- **When**: For passive data carriers -- configs, results, plans -- especially when you want `==`/hash semantics.
- **Trade-offs**: No validation by itself; frozen fields protect from mutation but not bad values (pair with pydantic for that).

### PyTorch tensor computation & autograd
- **What**: PyTorch is the numeric engine: `torch.Tensor` holds batched GPU/CPU arrays and `torch.autograd` builds the computation graph so gradients flow from a loss back to every parameter.
- **Why used here**: TRL, transformers, vLLM and this repo's RL loops are all built on PyTorch, so using it directly avoids impedance mismatch between framework and training code.
- **When**: Anywhere gradients must reach model weights -- training, RL rollouts, LoRA adaptation, or evaluation under a different dtype.
- **Trade-offs**: Eager execution is easy to debug but slower than compiled graphs; `torch.compile`/export recover speed at the cost of traceability.

### Hugging Face Transformers (pretrained models & tokenizers)
- **What**: The `transformers` library loads pretrained checkpoints (here Qwen3-8B) and their tokenizers behind a uniform `AutoModelForCausalLM`/`AutoTokenizer` interface.
- **Why used here**: It gives one stable API over many architectures plus hosted checkpoints, which is why it is the shared backbone across every framework in this repo.
- **When**: Any task that starts from an existing LLM and adds training, serving, or eval.
- **Trade-offs**: The abstraction hides internals; subtle differences between architectures can surprise you when you rely on undocumented behavior.

### Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases
- **What**: W&B records metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts to a hosted or local run timeline, giving every training run a shareable dashboard and history.
- **Why used here**: The repo treats receipts/evidence as first-class outputs, and W&B is one of the three independent channels (HF + W&B + GCS) whose agreement is the trust signal.
- **When**: When a run's value is in its history -- comparing sweeps, auditing, or sharing results without sending weights.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a network dependency and an external account; local-only runs must opt out or write a local fallback.

### HF TRL training library (PPO/GRPO-style RLHF)
- **What**: `trl` implements RLHF-style trainers (PPO, and the GRPO variant used here) that coordinate policy, reference model, reward computation, and rollout generation.
- **Why used here**: It removes the burden of writing the RL loop from scratch and is one of the five frameworks whose equivalence this repo proves.
- **When**: When you need a maintained, well-tested RLHF loop and accept its configuration model.
- **Trade-offs**: The library's opinionated defaults can fight custom research setups; equivalence testing exists precisely because each framework behaves slightly differently.

### Structural subtyping with typing.Protocol
- **What**: `Protocol` describes an interface by the *attributes* something has, not by inheritance -- anything matching the shape satisfies it (duck typing with static checks).
- **Why used here**: Lets the code accept `plan`-like and `run`-like objects without forcing a class hierarchy, useful in the shim layer.
- **When**: When many small objects share behavior but have no common ancestor.
- **Trade-offs**: Runtime `isinstance` checks need `@runtime_checkable` and are shallow; static checkers are the real beneficiary.
