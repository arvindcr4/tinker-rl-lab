## Overview
`n8_passrate_spectrum_20260704.py` is an experiment script that exercises a specific research configuration end-to-end. It wires a chosen model, dataset, algorithm, and backend into one reproducible run and records the outcome.
It leans on **argparse, asyncio, config, dataclass, logging, numpy, protocol, regex, transformers, viz, wandb** to do its work.
*Self-description:* "N8 — Per-prompt pass-rate spectrum (K rollouts/prompt) -> analytic ZVF(G).  Sampling-only Tinker experiment: K rollouts per GSM8K test prompt from the untouched"

## Key Components
- `get_args()` -- function
- `extract_and_score()` -- function
- `process_prompt()` -- function
- `run_all()` -- function
- `main()` -- function
- Has a `if __name__ == "__main__"` entry point

## Concepts & Decisions
### Frozen protocol over flexibility
- **What**: Experiments intentionally give up knob freedom in exchange for equivalence -- comparability beats configurability here.

### Hugging Face Transformers (pretrained models & tokenizers)
- **What**: The `transformers` library loads pretrained checkpoints (here Qwen3-8B) and their tokenizers behind a uniform `AutoModelForCausalLM`/`AutoTokenizer` interface.
- **Why used here**: It gives one stable API over many architectures plus hosted checkpoints, which is why it is the shared backbone across every framework in this repo.
- **When**: Any task that starts from an existing LLM and adds training, serving, or eval.
- **Trade-offs**: The abstraction hides internals; subtle differences between architectures can surprise you when you rely on undocumented behavior.

### Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases
- **What**: W&B records metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts to a hosted or local run timeline, giving every training run a shareable dashboard and history.
- **Why used here**: The repo treats receipts/evidence as first-class outputs, and W&B is one of the three independent channels (HF + W&B + GCS) whose agreement is the trust signal.
- **When**: When a run's value is in its history -- comparing sweeps, auditing, or sharing results without sending weights.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a network dependency and an external account; local-only runs must opt out or write a local fallback.

### Text processing with regular expressions
- **What**: `re` matches/extracts patterns in text -- parsing logs, sanitizing identifiers, or validating formats that don't warrant a full parser.
- **Why used here**: Receipts, path probes, and name munging are string-shaped; regex is the compact tool for targeted extraction.
- **When**: Small, well-defined text patterns where a parser is overkill.
- **Trade-offs**: Regex is opaque and easy to get subtly wrong; complex grammars should graduate to a real parser.

### Data visualization
- **What**: Matplotlib/Plotly render metrics into figures, replacing dense number tables with readable curves.
- **Why used here**: The repo produces decks and figures as code so charts derive from evidence and regenerate whenever the checkout changes.
- **When**: When a comparison (scaling curve, loss trace, ablation) is clearer as a picture than a table.
- **Trade-offs**: Figures need explicit styling to stay trustworthy; a miscalled axis or log scale can misrepresent the claim.

### Data modeling with dataclasses
- **What**: `@dataclass` auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` from field annotations, turning plain classes into compact value objects.
- **Why used here**: The repo models specs, results, and plans as frozen dataclasses so structural equality and hashing come for free and mutation is blocked.
- **When**: For passive data carriers -- configs, results, plans -- especially when you want `==`/hash semantics.
- **Trade-offs**: No validation by itself; frozen fields protect from mutation but not bad values (pair with pydantic for that).

### Asynchronous I/O (asyncio / async def)
- **What**: `async`/`await` lets one thread interleave many I/O-bound operations (network, subprocesses) instead of blocking on each.
- **Why used here**: Drivers that fan out to remote boxes or API calls benefit from overlapping wait-time; async is the idiomatic way to keep those concurrent.
- **When**: I/O-bound fan-out where you'd otherwise stall on many sequential round-trips; CPU-bound compute still needs threads/processes.
- **Trade-offs**: Async code is more invasive (an async function must await other async functions) and easier to deadlock if a blocking call sneaks in.

### Configuration as declarative data (YAML/JSON/TOML)
- **What**: Knobs live in YAML/JSON/TOML files or tables rather than code, so a run's intent is inspectable and diffable without reading the program.
- **Why used here**: A single frozen `CanonicalSpec` + preregistration files is the repo's whole comparability contract -- config-as-data is what makes runs hashable and testable.
- **When**: Anywhere parameters should be changeable without editing code, or compared across runs.
- **Trade-offs**: Config can drift from what the code actually reads; validation (pydantic) is what catches a key that no longer means what it says.

### Structural subtyping with typing.Protocol
- **What**: `Protocol` describes an interface by the *attributes* something has, not by inheritance -- anything matching the shape satisfies it (duck typing with static checks).
- **Why used here**: Lets the code accept `plan`-like and `run`-like objects without forcing a class hierarchy, useful in the shim layer.
- **When**: When many small objects share behavior but have no common ancestor.
- **Trade-offs**: Runtime `isinstance` checks need `@runtime_checkable` and are shallow; static checkers are the real beneficiary.

### Numeric arrays with NumPy
- **What**: NumPy gives dense N-d arrays and vectorized math (reductions, broadcasting) that run at C speed.
- **Why used here**: Reward computation and metrics are array operations; vectorizing over a batch is both faster and more readable than Python loops.
- **When**: Any batched numeric transform -- rewards, accuracy, aggregations across rollouts.
- **Trade-offs**: NumPy and torch each own their memory; converting between them copies unless you share storage carefully.

### Structured diagnostics with logging
- **What**: The `logging` module writes level-filtered messages to stderr/files, separating operational noise from real errors and leaving them toggleable at runtime.
- **Why used here**: Runs are audited, so leaving a trail of INFO/DEBUG statements lets a reviewer reconstruct what happened without rerunning GPUs.
- **When**: Anywhere you'd `print` something that matters: progress, warnings, step boundaries, and fatal errors.
- **Trade-offs**: More setup than `print`; misconfigured handler levels silently swallow the very lines you need in production.

### Command-line argument parsing
- **What**: `argparse` turns `sys.argv` into typed options (`--framework`, `--dry-run`) with help text and error handling for free.
- **Why used here**: Every platform entry point must be runnable by humans and by shelling-out code, so a stable, documented CLI is the contract between them.
- **When**: When a script is invoked by people, CI, or other processes and needs explicit knobs.
- **Trade-offs**: Boilerplate-heavy and positional-only; richer CLIs use click/typer for nesting and auto-generated help.
