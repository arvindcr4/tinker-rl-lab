## Overview
`remote_training.py` is a training path that runs gradient-based optimization (GRPO/PPO-style) over model weights. Rollouts are generated, scored by a reward model, and their feedback is backpropagated through a policy updated toward higher reward.
It leans on **config, peft, protocol, regex, torch, transformers, wandb** to do its work.

## Key Components
- `_json()` -- function
- `_verify_files()` -- function
- `download_corpus()` -- function
- `_heldout_source()` -- function
- `_model_stack()` -- function
- `_remote_checkpoint_manifests()` -- function
- `_download_checkpoint()` -- function
- `_checkpoint_upload()` -- function
- `_evaluation()` -- function
- `_final_artifacts()` -- function
- `train_unit()` -- function

## Concepts & Decisions
### Why the loop is GRPO and not full RLHF
- **What**: GRPO is the reward-model-free-online variant this protocol froze: it relies on group-relative advantage, cutting the value critic and memory.

### Configuration as declarative data (YAML/JSON/TOML)
- **What**: Knobs live in YAML/JSON/TOML files or tables rather than code, so a run's intent is inspectable and diffable without reading the program.
- **Why used here**: A single frozen `CanonicalSpec` + preregistration files is the repo's whole comparability contract -- config-as-data is what makes runs hashable and testable.
- **When**: Anywhere parameters should be changeable without editing code, or compared across runs.
- **Trade-offs**: Config can drift from what the code actually reads; validation (pydantic) is what catches a key that no longer means what it says.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA & friends)
- **What**: PEFT freezes the base weights and trains small low-rank adapter matrices (LoRA r=16 here) plus a handful of config classes (`LoraConfig`).
- **Why used here**: LoRA makes the canonical 30-step GRPO run affordable and makes checkpoints tiny and shareable -- the repo freezes `peft` into every framework path.
- **When**: When you want to adapt a large model without retraining it or shipping full copies.
- **Trade-offs**: Adapters cap what the model can learn and add a merge step before inference; k-bit quantized base weights complicate offloading.

### Structural subtyping with typing.Protocol
- **What**: `Protocol` describes an interface by the *attributes* something has, not by inheritance -- anything matching the shape satisfies it (duck typing with static checks).
- **Why used here**: Lets the code accept `plan`-like and `run`-like objects without forcing a class hierarchy, useful in the shim layer.
- **When**: When many small objects share behavior but have no common ancestor.
- **Trade-offs**: Runtime `isinstance` checks need `@runtime_checkable` and are shallow; static checkers are the real beneficiary.

### Text processing with regular expressions
- **What**: `re` matches/extracts patterns in text -- parsing logs, sanitizing identifiers, or validating formats that don't warrant a full parser.
- **Why used here**: Receipts, path probes, and name munging are string-shaped; regex is the compact tool for targeted extraction.
- **When**: Small, well-defined text patterns where a parser is overkill.
- **Trade-offs**: Regex is opaque and easy to get subtly wrong; complex grammars should graduate to a real parser.

### PyTorch tensor computation & autograd
- **What**: PyTorch is the numeric engine: `torch.Tensor` holds batched GPU/CPU arrays and `torch.autograd` builds the computation graph so gradients flow from a loss back to every parameter.
- **Why used here**: TRL, transformers, vLLM and this repo's RL loops are all built on PyTorch, so using it directly avoids impedance mismatch between framework and training code.
- **When**: Anywhere gradients must reach model weights -- training, RL rollouts, LoRA adaptation, or evaluation under a different dtype.
- **Trade-offs**: Eager execution is easy to debug but slower than compiled graphs; `torch.compile`/export recover speed at the cost of traceability.

### Hugging Face Transformers (pretrained models & tokenizers)
- **What**: The `transformers` library loads pretrained checkpoints (here Qwen3-8B) and their tokenizers behind a uniform `AutoModelForCausalLM`/`AutoTokenizer` interface.
- **Why used here**: It gives one stable API over many architectures plus hosted checkpoints, which is why it is the shared backbone across every framework in this repo.
- **When**: Any task that starts from an existing LLM and adds training, serving, or eval.
- **Trade-offs**: The abstraction hides internals; subtle differences between architectures can surprise you when you rely on undocumented behavior.

### Experiment tracking with Weights & Biases
- **What**: W&B records metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts to a hosted or local run timeline, giving every training run a shareable dashboard and history.
- **Why used here**: The repo treats receipts/evidence as first-class outputs, and W&B is one of the three independent channels (HF + W&B + GCS) whose agreement is the trust signal.
- **When**: When a run's value is in its history -- comparing sweeps, auditing, or sharing results without sending weights.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a network dependency and an external account; local-only runs must opt out or write a local fallback.
